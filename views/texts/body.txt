For this marks the first year of the rooster, who hath in his benevelance, bestowed upon interns the grace of his beak. With the beat of his wings he takes not flight, but more like a weird hop or something into our hearts and minds. Where the teaming masses call him fowl, we call him, glorious. For he doth shower us with gifts of eggs and feathers and by his mighty beak doth he crow the cresting of the morning sun, announcing for all the beginnings of a new day.
